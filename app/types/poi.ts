 * While POIs are stored as GeoJSON Features for MapLibre layer rendering

 * This flattened structure is used for:
 * - Geocoding operations (translating POI to coordinates) because MiniSearch requires flat objects
 * - Discovery panel state management
 *
 * Use this type instead of GeoJSON.Feature when working with search and UI components.
